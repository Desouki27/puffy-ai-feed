Which type of pillow is best?

How much do sleeping pillows cost?

What should I look for in a pillow?
A pillow should be comfortable but also supportive. It should contour your head and keep it aligned with your neck. A thin pillow is recommended for stomach and back sleepers, while a thicker pillow is recommended for side sleepers. The Puffy Signature Pillow offers adjustable comfort, as you can unzip the inner sleeve and add or remove foam. It's therefore suitable for all sleeping positions.

Coleman Pusateri 
Better Alternative to Memory Foam
Being a lifelong down pillow person, I’ve also been hesitant of any pillow that wasn’t down. Despite by hesitation, I have found that Puffy pillows, once you get use to them, are very comfortable and supportive.

Deborah Dufer 
Awesome products, Puffy!!
I bought a Puffy mattress four years ago and at the time it was running a promo that offered free gifts with my purchase. So I also received the mattress protector, two pillows and a set of sheets. The mattress and pillows are super supportive, and the sheets feel amazing, even after almost four years of constant use! Recently, I decided I needed to buy another pillow..of course I went Puffy! It's firm yet squishy enough that I can press the pillow exactly where I want it i...Show full review

Very puffy
I love this pillow. It is very thick but also very soft. Has a lot of filling. Keeps my neck aligned and I wake up with no neck pain. Highly recommend.

Chrissy Rausch 
The BEST pillow
I am obsessed with the Puffy pillow! It is beautiful. The comfort is unbeatable. It really is just a high end product that you will not regret buying. I can tell this pillow is going to last. It comes with a cover. Which is so smart. Nobody does that. I usually have to buy separate. If I could give more than 5 stars I will. Their customer service is amazing. They are so quick to help you and email back. I will be buying more!
